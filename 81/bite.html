<p>In this Bite we collected some random tweets and populated a list of namedtuples of text and a polarity rating which we got using <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/" target="_blank"><code>TextBlob</code></a>, an awesome module that makes it easy to do sentiment analysis (we used it for <a href="https://pybit.es/codechallenge07_review.html" target="_blank">our PCC07</a>):<pre>
  blob = TextBlob(tweet)
  polarity = blob.sentiment.polarity
</pre></p><p>A polarity of < 0 indicates a negative sentiment, > 0 a positive one.</p><p>In this Bite we practice list comprehensions and sorting. Complete the two functions below following their docstrings. Enjoy and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
