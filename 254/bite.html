<p>This Bite is to illustrate scoping. You will sum numbers while keeping track of number of hundreds in a <em>global</em> variable called <code>num_hundreds</code>.</p>

<p>To illustrate this see this REPL output: <pre>
>>> from scoping import sum_numbers, num_hundreds
>>> num_hundreds
-1
>>> sum_numbers([10, 20, 70])
100
>>> from scoping import num_hundreds
>>> num_hundreds
0
>>> sum_numbers([10, 120, 180])
310
>>> from scoping import num_hundreds
>>> num_hundreds
3
</pre></p>

<p>We planned to also illustrate <code>nonlocal</code>, but we will do that in a separate Bite ... Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
