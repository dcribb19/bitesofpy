# The Challenge

Analyze statistics of Olympic Games in a CSV file that you can find on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games).

## Basic/Required

1. Find out the (male and female) athlete who won most medals in all the Summer Olympic Games (1896-2014).

2. Display the first 10 countries that won most medals.

3. Create a bar plot which shows the total medals won for each sport during the summer Olympics.

### <b>One Requirement:</b> use pandas to create a dataframe you can work on.

### Bonus

- To take this even further you could create a map and choose colors for each Country, pointing out the ones which won most medals. To get started on this, you can try plotly library, and specifically Choropleth Maps in Python.
