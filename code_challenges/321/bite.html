<p>Magic numbers are bytes that can be used to uniquely identify certain file formats. Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files, for example, usually start with the byte sequence <code>89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A</code>. This can be useful to determine file types when file extensions are missing or wrong.</p>
<p>In this Bite you will write a function that identifies file types using a supplied magic numbers table. Arbitrary single bytes in the magic byte sequence are indicated by two question marks (<code>??</code>) as in the case of the JPG format. If the file type cannot be determined the function should raise an <code>FileNotRecognizedException</code>.</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; determine_filetype_by_magic_bytes("/tmp/image.png")<br />'Image encoded in the Portable Network Graphics format'<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; determine_filetype_by_magic_bytes("/tmp/image.txt")<br />Traceback (most recent call last):<br />...<br />magic_bytes.FileNotRecognizedException: /tmp/image.txt: File format not recognized</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to strip out the comments in parenthesis from byte sequences in the magic table (e.g. JPG format).</p>
