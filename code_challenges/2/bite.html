<p>Learn Python regular expressions by writing the following 3 functions. </p><p>In each function's <code>docstring</code> we show the expected result. </p><p>The tests verify these expected results when you hit <i>Save + Verify</i>. We will do a more ample regex bite later on.</p><p<i>Note that for parsing HTML you would use a library of some sort, this is just to train your regex skills.</i></p><p><strong>Update 14th of Aug 2019</strong>: we updated the template slightly (text inputs are passed into the functions) to improve the tests for this Bite. If you get confusing result, use <i>Try again</i> to start with the updated template.</p>
