<p>Pat is going to apply for a cashier job in the local supermarket.</p>
<p>His friends suggested to brush up his basic math skills, particularly <em>how to make changes in different coin denominations</em>.</p>
<p>Can you help him leveraging your programming skills?</p>
<p>Given a list of positive integers representing coins denominations, and a positivie integer N representing the requested change of money, come up with a function that calculates the number of ways to make the change using the given coins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can assume there is an unlimited amount of coins in each denominations.</p>
<pre>## Example:<br /><br />n = 5 and coins = [1, 2, 5, 10]<br /><br />&gt;&gt; make_change(n, coins)<br />4 (five "1", 1+1+1+2, 1+2+2, and one "5") <br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; make_change(6, coins)<br />5 </pre>
