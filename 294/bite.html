<p>If you've never tried bowling, it's a fun game to play but keeping score can be confusing when you're first getting started.</p>
<p>In this Bite you will be given a string of frame data and need to complete the <code>calculate_score()</code> function and return a final score.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strikes are represented with an <code>X</code>, spares with a <code>/</code>, and gutter balls with a <code>-</code>.</p>
<p>Details on how to keep score can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Traditional_scoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.bowl.com/Welcome/Welcome_Home/Keeping_Score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
